I am a mathematician from the University of Buenos Aires, FCEN, and I am deeply passionate about my work.

I am currently completing my PhD on the topic of Non-linear problems from the study of financial models. I have excellent report writing skills and a good understanding of data-science, machine learning and smart contracts.
